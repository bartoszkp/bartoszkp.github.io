My name is Bartosz Papis and this is my website. Its purpose is to gather all important information about me. If, however, you think that this purpose is not served, feel free to contact me.<br /><br />

Although my name is "Bartosz" (ˈbartɔʂ), on a day-to-day basis, I usually use its diminutive form - "Bartek" (ˈbartɛk).<br /><br />

I like my middle name "Kazimierz" (kaˈʑimʲɛʂ) and that's why I try to mention it as often as possible, usually on formal occasions (or on websites).
